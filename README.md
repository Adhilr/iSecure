# iSecure
iOS application

Often we required certain personal data to be private yet available everywhere. The data should be safe and confidential, at the same time it should be accessable from anywhere.
We have come up with this application that uses Two Factor Authetication. The user can access the data after logining in and answering a security question that has been framed by the users themselves. 
This app uses Google's Sign In, Firebase, Swift 3 and is implemented in XCode.
